# VBA of Wall Street

##Overview of Project

###Background
Steve is doing research on the stock market for his parents. I created a workbook that analyzed 12 stocks' performances in 2017 and 2018, but Steve wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. I will look to improve on the initial code to potentially help Steve's expanded research. 

###Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to improve upon a VBA code used to analyze 12 stocks in each year. The code is refactored to make it more efficient by taking fewer steps and improving the logic. To prove this, the refactored code includes the timer to help measure performance against the original code. 

##Results

###Stock Performance: 2017 vs 2018
11 out of 12 stocks performed positively in 2017, while only 2 out of the 12 stocks did so the following year. ENPH and RUN performed well in both years, with RUN improving upon its 2017 performance.
